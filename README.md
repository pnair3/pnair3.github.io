# next steps for project development
When implementing a project with file sets like these, I recommend including a README file like the one right here to display the project title and a little information about the project. Some example potential things to include in such a project are below. (And it is always good to include the URL to your live, deployed project site for easy access!)

PROJECT TITLE
(and subtitle, if one exists)

by

(your name/byline)

About the Project

(Put a short summary / abstract / description of your project at the beginning)

Add the URL Link to your <a href="https://racheldaniell.github.io/project-files-demonstration/">live project site</a> for easy access right from the code files and ReadMe.


About the project development:

(A description of the context of your project and your approach to project development. This will be specific to your own process, but might include some or all of the following examples: reasons why you chose your topic/project, external links, inspiration for your project, additional detail about your interest in the topic beyond what your project captures, design notes/drawings/screen shots/moodboards/wordbanks/etc. documenting your project development process, and/or screencaptures of your project in process. The purpose of this section is to give the viewer a sense of your project development process.)

Data / Sources:

(if your project is based on data, you should specify those sources -- these should also be listed on your project site itself)

References / external acknowledgements 

(things like sources beyond the data used, bibliographies, organizations you drew expertise from in your analysis, etc. -- these should also be listed on your project site itself)

(... And end your README with notes on anything someone from the public interested in your project might want to know about the context of your creation!)
