My Portfolio.

About the Project

The Portfolio provides a brief introduction about me and my work experience. Additionally it provides an entry point to various UX case studies I've designed for various clients over the 3 years I've been in this field. However, currently they can't be accessed through the website due to NDA. Additionally you can go on to view some of my digital illustrations and animations I've created to showcase my hobby which are linked to their respective instagram post.

About the project development:


Considering this was my first time coding with HTML and CSS, I took guidance from Professor Rachel Daniel and Tech Tutor TK Cram, who helped with the set-up and various issues I faced during my process. I started with the basic template that Rachel taught us in the initial few classes of learning HTML and then proceeded to create my top header navigation bar and footer elements for my Homepage (index.html), beyond which I began styling both these elements in my CSS. I faced multiple issues with figuring out how to make my Nav bar sticky, which was easily resolved once I consulted TK. 

I then began duplicating my header, top nav and footer elements across all my pages (work.html, Illustrations.html), making minor changes to each of these pages such that I'm able to visually able to highlight which page the user is currently on. 

Once the basic set-up was done, I then proceeded to create content for my Main section under each of these pages.

For the landing page/Homepage, I am introducing myself briefly which i supported with the digital self-portrait that I created, followed by a few other illustrations indicating my secondary interests. these images were individually linked to their respective posts along with my Instagram ID, which was also linked to my Instagram handle. 

I wanted to showcase my work experience in tabular format such that the first column stated the name of the company I have worked for over the years, and the second column stated my work experience across these companies. Rather than a simple paragraph for each row, I put my experience in an unordered list. Furthermore, when clicked on, each company name redirects users to their respective websites. 

Once satisfied with my homepage, I began designing and coding for the illustrations.html page. I inserted all my illustrations and styled them similarly to ensure they were of the same size. I added a hover element to showcase each illustration's captions. Similar to that of the landing page, I linked each of the images to their respective Instagram post. 

For the work.html page, I planned to show each case study in a card format. For this, I took help from freecodecamp, which taught me how to code for this component in HTML and CSS. Once the basic structure was ready, I altered the CSS to meet my specific styling needs and inserted my mockups. Since I have yet to figure out how to showcase these case studies without breaking NDA, I have decided not to link them anywhere. 

Throughout the process, at the end of each day, I pushed my code to GitHub and ran it frequently through the HTML and CSS code validator. Any issues that popped up in these validators, I resolved them constantly.
